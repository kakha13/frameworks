## Framework for dynamic commerce

Hydrogen's React-based framework for building custom storefronts on Shopify gives you everything you need to start fast, build fast, and deliver the best personalized shopping experiences.

## A modern way to build

Hydrogen makes that possible by integrating React Server Components, streaming server-side rendering with suspense, and smart caching defaults. Paired with the globally distributed Storefront API, Shopify-optimized commerce components, and a Vite-powered developer environment, itâ€™s the fast framework for developers and customers.
